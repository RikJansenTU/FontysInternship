# Research Report

## How can I use generative AI to increase fan engagement?
This is the main research question I want to answer during my internship. Fan engagement is a broad concept in this context - it doesn't mean that everything I build will need to be used by sports fans directly, but it should serve them or improve their experience when interacting with TDE's products, which in turn will increase engagement.

### Conclusions

## What different types of generative AI exist, and how can they be used in innovative new ways?
Exploring the types of AI available, as well as their uses, will play an important part in achieving the internship's goals.

### Methods
_Available product analysis / community research:_ A lot of research has already been done into this aspect of AI, so I'll have many tools I can use and build upon, many of which are open source. I had to determine which existing tools best suited my needs and how they could be implemented.  
_Prototyping:_ I set up a series of simple prototypes that I could use to test different models and compare them. The resulting Jupyter Notebooks can be found [here](https://github.com/RikJansenTU/PodcastSummarizer), and the results of the tests as well as the available product research can be found in this [research report](/Project_1/AI_Model_Research.md).

### Conclusions

## What are the needs of TDE's various customers, and how can I fulfill those?
If I can anticipate these customers' needs, and find a way to use AI to meet them, TDE will be able to proactively offer solutions, potentially earning them new clients or additional assignments.

### Methods
_Interviews:_ RacingNews365's office is located on the same floor as TDE, so I could easily communicate about their needs. The initial [requirements](/Project_1/Requirements.md) were formulated based on a meeting where they indicated their needs. I also plan to deliver the finished application to them, so they get a chance to use it and give feedback.  
There are also client leads at TDE who are aware of the needs of not only RacingNews365 but also other clients, who I could discuss implementation with.  

### Conclusions

## Where does the passion of the sports fans that consume TDE's products lie, and how can I use AI to respond to those passions in a positive way?
The nice thing about a company that focuses on sports is that the end users tend to be very passionate about their engagement. This offers a unique opportunity to create something positive that these fans truly enjoy interacting with.

### Conclusions

## What ethical considerations have to be taken into account when working with generative AI?
AI will very likely have a massive impact on our society, enabling us to do and create things unheard of a decade ago. Even more than with most new technology, it could be used to do a great amount of harm, for example with misinformation, spam, or by replacing jobs. I feel like any individual or company developing something with AI has a responsibility to consider how it could be abused.
