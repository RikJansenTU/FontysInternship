## How can I use generative AI to increase fan engagement?
This is the main research question I want to answer during my internship. Fan engagement is a broad concept in this context - it doesn't mean that everything I build will need to be used by sports fans directly, but it should serve them or improve their experience when interacting with TDE's products, which in turn will increase engagement.

## What different types of generative AI exist, and how can they be used in innovative new ways?
Exploring the types of AI available, as well as their uses, will play an important part in achieving the internship's goals.

### Methods
**Available product analysis / community research:** Over the last years the number of freely available AI tools has exploded, so I'll have many I can use and build upon. I had to determine if there were existing tools that suited my needs and how they could be implemented. Also, being aware of the available tools ensured I wasn't creating anything that already existed, and allowed me to identify areas where innovation was still possible.  
**Literature study:** If no ready-to-use tools were available, I had to figure out how to implement and apply generative AI models myself, which required research into how these models work.  
**Prototyping:** I set up a series of simple prototypes that I could use to test different models and compare them, as well as getting to grips with the technology involved.

### Conclusions
AI tools are quickly becoming easier to use and implement for your own goals - for example, OpenAI released a Whisper API several weeks after I had finished project 1, making transcription significantly easier. For many areas, however, easy-to-use tools and well-implemented and documented APIs are still difficult to find, which can be both an advantage and a disadvantage.  
On the one hand, it made the engineering side of some of my projects significantly harder, but on the other hand it does mean that there is still a lot of space to innovate and create something completely new. I think the greatest potential for a company like TDE is in using and combining existing models to do something novel, keeping an eye on new developments and being one of the first companies to bring them to the greater public in an accessible way.  
I don't think trying to develop and train AI models from scratch is worth it, considering the knowledge and costs required, especially considering there are so many great models available as open-source projects.

The Jupyter Notebooks with my protypes for project 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/RikJansenTU/PodcastSummarizer).  
A more comprehensive research report on transcription and summarization AI models can be found in [this research report](/Project_1/AI_Model_Research.md).  
A research report on fine-tuning a text-to-image AI model with custom subjects can be found [here]().
Some samples from my experimentation with prompt building for project can be found [here]().

## What are the needs of TDE's various customers, and how can I fulfill those?
If I can anticipate these customers' needs, and find a way to use AI to meet them, TDE will be able to proactively offer solutions, potentially earning them new clients or additional assignments.

### Methods
**Brainstorm:**  
**Interviews:** RacingNews365's office is located on the same floor as TDE, so I could easily communicate about their needs. The initial [requirements](/Project_1/Requirements.md) were formulated based on a meeting where they indicated their needs.  
There are also client leads at TDE who are aware of the needs of not only RacingNews365 but also other clients, who I could discuss implementation with.  
**Stakeholder analysis:**  

### Conclusions

## Where does the passion of the sports fans that consume TDE's products lie, and how can I use AI to respond to those passions in a positive way?
The nice thing about a company that focuses on sports is that the end users tend to be very passionate about their engagement. This offers a unique opportunity to create something positive that these fans truly enjoy interacting with.

### Conclusions

## What ethical considerations have to be taken into account when working with generative AI?
AI will very likely have a massive impact on our society, enabling us to do and create things unheard of a decade ago. Even more than with most new technology, it could be used to do a great amount of harm, for example with misinformation, spam, or by replacing jobs. I feel like any individual or company developing something with AI has a responsibility to consider how it could be abused.
