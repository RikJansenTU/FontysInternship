# Personal Reflection
A summary of my personal and professsional development during the internship, the things I learned, and the challenges I faced. 

### Personal Goals
Figure out what I want to do
Combining creativity and tech
Find out what kind of environment I want to work in
Dive deeper into AI and its possibilities

### Challenges
I've never been good at planning, especially when working on my own, so figuring out how best to manage my projects proved a challenge. While I do see the use having a solid overview of what I'm working on and what still needs to be done, I notice there needs to be a certain balance; if don't have enough flexibility my planning can actually have a negative effect. 
Furthermore, it's something I hate doing, so spending too much time on can be very demotivating.  
After some experimentation throughout the internship, I think I managed to strike a pretty good balance between structure and flexibility, the results of which were noticeable during the third project, which went quite well despite its unexpected complexity.

Another challenge arose from the fact that I wasn't used to working in a company setting as an IT professional. It involved a mix of individual work and being part of a group, which I wasn't used to. I have a tendency to isolate myself when working on something, and as a result I often forget to keep others informed. This was complicated by the fact that TDE is a small company without a dedicated internship mentor: mine was always available, but more of the responsibility was on me.  
This was especially apparent during the first project, and one of the biggest points of feedback I got during my midterm assessment. I tried to involve my company mentor and the rest of TDE in my work more, discussing what I was working on with them more often and asking for feedback. I think this went fairly well, but it's still something I need to work on, especially when working alone.  
I also tried to actively look for feedback from my Fontys assessor, especially regarding my portfolio, something I rarely did in previous semesters, which I hope improved my end result.

Technology-wise, this semester definitely offered some of the biggest challenges I've ever faced over the course of my education, especially because of the lack of proper tutorials and support, but working on these projects was mostly quite fun and interesting. I think I could have taken the first project a bit further, but by the third I think I got as far as I possibly could have in the time I had.

Lastly, I have always struggled with certain elements of my education; while I completely understand the need, I will never enjoy writing documentation and portfolios, or doing certain kinds of research. Thanks to this, I have always put off on having to work on those until the last possible minute, resulting in more stress and worse end results.  
This semester, I spread out work on the portfolio much more, getting started and asking for feedback early on. I also integrated my research into the projects better instead of doing it all afterwards as an afterthought, as well as doing more different types of research, trying to cover a variety of bases.

### The Future
When I was looking for internships, I wanted to find a company that employed not just programmers but people from a variety of backgrounds, as well a someplace that would give me the opportunity for a more creative approach. Many of the businesses that fit that bill did something with marketing, so me ending up at one of those wasn't surprising, but I have realised that that the industry isn't one that I want to work in long-term.
While I enjoy the fact that you work on a lot of different projects in short succession, I don't find many of them very inspiring; I'd prefer to work on things with more direct societial benefit, or some sort of creative payoff.  
That said, I still really enjoyed my time at TDE, the opportunity and freedom I got to further investigate a subject I'm very interested in, and I liked working in the small but diverse team.

The internship has given me two other avenues to consider, the first being related to AI. I noticed over the past two semesters working with  AI that I'm very interested in its ethical and regulatory aspects, and this is something I'd be interested in exploring further, for example through a philosophy minor.  
The second is a different direction: I still want to do something creative, but I'd like that creativity to be much more pronounced, for example doing something in the animation industry. To this end, I'll be doing an open learning semester following this internship, to further explore how I can combine programming with visual art.
