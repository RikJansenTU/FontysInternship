# Personal Reflection
A summary of my personal and professsional development during the internship, the things I learned, and the challenges I faced. 

## Personal Goals
Figure out what I want to do
Combining creativity and tech
Find out what kind of environment I want to work in
Dive deeper into AI and its possibilities

## Challenges
Planning stuff
Not being used to working in a company setting, keeping other people up to date with what you're working on
Went better later (for example with feedback on portfolio), still progress to be made
AI tech was definitely most complicated thing I've done but quite fun to work with
Struggle with certain aspects of education, documentation, some research, want to get to work
  started with portfolio much sooner, tried to do as much research as possible

## The Future
Marketing not really for me, still really enjoyed my time at TDE
Want to try some different stuff, things that are more directly creative (decided to do open learning to explore that avenue)
Ethical side of AI interesting - philosophy minor?
