# Personal Reflection
A summary of my personal and professsional development during the internship, the things I learned, and the challenges I faced. 

### Personal Goals
Figure out what I want to do
Combining creativity and tech
Find out what kind of environment I want to work in
Dive deeper into AI and its possibilities

### Challenges
Planning stuff
Not being used to working in a company setting, keeping other people up to date with what you're working on
Went better later (for example with feedback on portfolio), still progress to be made
AI tech was definitely most complicated thing I've done but quite fun to work with
Struggle with certain aspects of education, documentation, some research, want to get to work
  started with portfolio much sooner, tried to do as much research as possible

### The Future
When I was looking for internships, I wanted to find a company that employed not just programmers but people from a variety of backgrounds, as well a someplace that would give me the opportunity for a more creative approach. Many of the businesses that fit that bill did something with marketing, so me ending up at one of those wasn't surprising, but I have realised that that the industry isn't one that I want to work in long-term.
While I enjoy the fact that you work on a lot of different projects in short succession, I don't find many of them very inspiring; I'd prefer to work on things with more direct societial benefit, or some sort of creative payoff.  
That said, I still really enjoyed my time at TDE, the opportunity and freedom I got to further investigate a subject I'm very interested in, and I liked working in the small but diverse team.

The internship has given me two other avenues to consider, the first being related to AI. I noticed over the past two semesters working with  AI that I'm very interested in its ethical and regulatory aspects, and this is something I'd be interested in exploring further, for example through a philosophy minor.  
The second is a different direction: I still want to do something creative, but I'd like that creativity to be much more pronounced, for example doing something in the animation industry. To this end, I'll be doing an open learning semester following this internship, to further explore how I can combine programming with visual art.
