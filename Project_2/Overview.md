# Project 2: Sports Icons
TDE will be hosting a Web3 showcase, where they are inviting several high-profile executives in the sports industry to present the opportunities that several new technologies offer. As a part of this conference, they would like to show off something impressive created by generative AI. In keeping with TDE's sports focus, I made a tool that generates video and audio of a famous athlete based on text input, for example allowing you to generate a video of Michael jordan welcoming guests to the conference.

## Exploration and Planning

Based on feedback, I tried to create a more extensive planning for this project, which can be found [here](Planning.md).

I tried to involve the other TDE employees in the process from the get-go, setting up a meeting with them to discuss possibilities and opportunities for the project, as well as its scope.

Ethics of generating videos of celebrities
