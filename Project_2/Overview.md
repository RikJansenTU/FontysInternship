# Project 2: Sports Icons  
TDE will be hosting a Web3 showcase, where they are inviting several high-profile executives in the sports industry to present the opportunities that several new technologies offer. As a part of this conference, they would like to show off something impressive created by generative AI. In keeping with TDE's sports focus, I made a tool that generates video and audio of a famous athlete based on text input, for example allowing you to generate a video of Michael jordan welcoming guests to the conference.

## Research Questions

- **How can I use generative AI to increase fan engagement?**  

- **What different types of generative AI exist, and how can they be used in innovative new ways?**

- **What are the needs of TDE's various customers, and how can I fulfill those?**

- **What ethical considerations have to be taken into account when working with generative AI?**


## Project Process

### Exploration and Planning  
I tried to involve the other TDE employees in the process from the get-go, setting up a meeting with them to discuss possibilities and opportunities for the project, as well as its scope. We discussed the end goal of what I would be making, and how we could best achieve that goal, as well as doing some initial brainstorming.

Since video generation is considerably more difficult than anything text-related, we decided that this project would make use of existing tools, combining several of those into a new application that met the needs of TDE. I also wanted to spend a bit more time on the UX this time, making something that's accessible and easy to use.

Based on feedback, I then tried to create a more extensive planning for this project, which can be found [here](Planning.md).

### First Research  
Much of my initial research was into the tools I wanted to make use of. I had to consider quality, usability (for example having an API), as well as cost. The voice generation was fairly easy: I quickly landed on [ElevenLabs](https://www.elevenlabs.io) because of its solid API, fast and high quality voice generation, and relatively low cost.

Video generation proved more difficult; while there are a variety of different tools available, many generate mediocre results. Of the highest quality ones, none that I could find allow you to generate video based on celebrities. After meeting with the stakeholders at TDE to present some options, we decided to generate the video based on an athlete's likeness created with [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com), an AI capable of generating lifelike images, currently the best in its category. 
This circuimvents the limitations as well as adding another layer of AI, which serves the projects goal of showing off the technology's capabilities.
For generating the talking head video based on the Midjourney image I decided to use [D-ID](https://www.d-id.com), because it netted the best results out of every tool I experimented with.

### Development  
I wanted to create a solid base for my application, which I could iteratively improve upon, as well as use to experiment with. I chose one athlete to focus on; Michael Jordan. If I could get the tool working for one person, it would be easy to add others. 

I started with the voice generation, which was fairly easy to get working, and I was quickly able to get great results. I also used this first prototype to start working on the UI, discussing potential changes with colleagues, which resulted in a more reactive and stripped down UI for the second prototype.

After that, I got started on the video aspect; this was more difficult, both due to the aforementioned restrictions placed on generating videos based on celebrities and the complexity of the API I was using. We experimented with generating portraits using Midjourney, getting as good of a likeness as possible, and used the best results to generate the video.

All that remained was to combine the audio and video generation, and make sure everything was functioning correctly. Some last-minute changes had to be made because one of the endpoints I was using stopped working, but I managed Considering the tool was supposed to be used by TDE, I wanted to make the code clean and easy to adjust, as well as facilitating the addition of more athletes in the future, even without my assistance. 

The repository with the code for the application can be found [here](https://github.com/RikJansenTU/SportIcons).

## Reflection  
The development of this project was quite different from that of the the previous one: it didn't present as much of a technical challenge because I was making use of APIs, so the focus was more on combining existing tools into something new, and creating an app that was easy to use and corresponded to TDE's brief. To achieve this, I gathered much more feedback, showing my progress several times a week, and discussing the direction I was going and what could be improved.

This helped me refine and improve my prototypes, and helped me come up with new approaches to the challenges I faced, for example the usage of Midjourney to circuimvent D-ID's filters. It also made the project more focused; instead of creating requirements beforehand and getting to work on my own, the more frequent discussion of my progress ensured I had a better idea of what TDE was looking for, and allowed me to make changes accordingly.

The more detailed planning I made also helped me stay organized and on track, and made sure I always knew what I was working on or had to get started with. I do think the way I set up the planning was a bit too restrictive: it would've been nice to have some space to account for unforseen delays, like when one of the API endpoints I was using suddenly stopped working and I had to rewrite part of my application.
For my next project I might use something like a Kanban board, to still be able to efficiently manage my tasks, but be a bit more flexible overall.

While I'm quite happy with my end result, I unfortunately didn't have much as much time as I would have liked to work on the frontend, for example giving the tool TDE colors and branding. I have scheduled some dedicated time to work on the frontend of all my finished applications towards the end of the internship, because I do think the way they look is important in their function as an AI showcase for TDE.

## Ethical Considerations  
The ethical considerations of AI are increasingly being discussed, and there are some very obvious dangers to a tool like this one. Being able to have a celebrity say anything you want them to can create some serious misinformation, like the [AI-generated video of president Zelensky surrendering to Vladimir Putin](https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository/ai-and-algorithmic-incidents-and-controversies/president-zelenskyy-deepfake-surrender). 
Right now, a discerning eye will still be able to spot the flaws with relative ease, but when something is posted to social media most people will still accept what they see without giving it a second look, like with the [image of Pope Francis wearing a puffer jacket](https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository/ai-and-algorithmic-incidents-and-controversies/deepfake-pope-francis-wears-white-puffa-jacket) that was spread around recently. As these tools advance, the flaws will be harder and harder to spot, making it easier to fool people.

I personally have some reservations about this kind of technology, so I tried to use this project as a way to investigate what is currently possible, and how these tools could be abused. I don't actually believe it should be illegal to generate videos of celebrities; parody and satire of well-known people has a long history and can definitely have artistic merit. I do feel like a few safety guidelines should always be kept in mind, and I came up with the following based on my work on this project.

_Private or Internal Use_  
The easiest way of ensuring AI tools don't get abused is to never release them to the wider public, and only use them internally. This is how the app I made is intended to be used, which removes a lot of the potential for misuse, but unfortunately a lot of tools are created specifically to be used by others. If this is the case, I think some other safety measures should be implemented.

_Watermarks and Indicators of Origin_  
I think that when it comes to these ultra-realistic portrayals it should always be clearly indicated that it was generated by AI. Part of this responsibility lies with the person creating the content, who should disclose how it was made (for example by TDE clearly telling those who see the video about its origins).  
The other part of this responsibility lies with the company offering the tools that can be used to create these videos. D-ID automatically adds a watermark to their generated content, but this is very easy to crop out. Ideally, they should add some form of digital 'fingerprint' that can't be removed, something that can be used to definitively establish that it's AI generated. A good next step in development would be adding a watermark of my own to the end result.

_Better Safety Protection_  
I believe any tools facilitating the mimicry of someone's voice or appearance has an obligation to implement certain safety features, like automatically detecting celebrities. This doesn't prevent all abuse - someone could still generate and circulate a video of a colleague saying something offensive. Requiring someone to send in a video giving their permission for their likeness to be used would already be much safer.  
D-ID already has protections in place, although they can still be circuimvented like discussed earlier. Elevenlabs has zero safety measures whatsoever, their official tutorial even showing how to clone Leonardo DiCaprio's voice. 

_Personal Responsibility_  
Even just a faked voice fragment has a lot of potential to be used for misinformation, and I believe a company like Elevenlabs has a responsibility to try to minimise this potential as much as possible. Ideally, a comprehensive set of laws will be created to govern AI development and usage, but technology will always outpace regulation, so a large part of the responsibility has to fall on the shoulders of individuals and companies.  
This means TDE, and myself as an extension, have to ensure that the app I created is never used to deceive or misinform. It's also up to me to make sure TDE is aware of the ethical and legal implications a tool like this can have.

### The Future  

There's a lot of elements of this issue that I haven't discussed, but that do warrant potential investigation in the future; not only ethical, but also social and legal, for example with regards to fair use or portrait rights. A lot of these issues don't have clear answers yet considering how relatively new this technology is.

I admit there's a certain conflict in me creating this tool, considering the ethical reservations I have with AI. I do however believe that one of the best way to investigate sociological and ethical impact of a certain technology is to get hands-on experience, seeing what tools are available and how their safety measures can be circuimvented. I've noticed that I'm very interested in examining these types of issues, and it's something I'd like to further explore in the future. AI will be a big theme in the coming years, and there's a lot that's still unclear about how its future will and should look; I'd like to play a part in figuring that out.
