## First Weeks

Brainstorming, research into possibilities of AI (document?)

Different themes

## Project 1: Podcast Summarizer

### Exploration and Planning

From the start, I had a pretty clear view of my assignment, and what my end result would be used for. TDE had already discussed using tools like these with RacingNews365, and could tell me what the requirements were.

### Research into Transcription Models

### Prototyping and Implementation

Figuring out how to use different models, challenges, end result(?), source code

Demo

Hosting finished products on TDE domain

### Future Steps and User Testing

Better looking frontend

Getting timestamps

I want to offer the tool I created to RacingNews, and hopefully have them use it for a few weeks, after which I can hold some short interviews to get their throughts on it. It'll be interesting to see if they make use of it, and to hear their feedback.

### Reflection and Feedback

Overall, setting up and making use of the AI models proved easier than expected, which allowed me to get going with prototyping and experimentation quite quickly. 

One thing I want to improve during the next project is my planning. While I did outline what I wanted to work on at the start of the assignment, I didn't make a very extensive or detailed list. For the next project, I want to plan out my activities more precisely, documenting exactly how long I think each activity will take. This will also make it easier for my coordinators, at both Fontys and TDE, to see what I'm working on.

Being more open about my work was a point of feedback I got from my TDE internship coordinator. When I get started on a project, I tend to dive in by myself, and I sometimes struggle letting other people know what I'm working on or asking for help. While I'm pretty happy with the technical end result of this first project, I think I can still take a lot of steps in how I act as part of TDE.
I think this struggle with involving others is partially due to the different work environment, suddenly being part of a larger team but without explicitly working on the same things. Starting next project, I want to take a more proactive approach in gathering feedback, asking for help, and showing off my work, for example by planning meetings with other team members to discuss my progress.
