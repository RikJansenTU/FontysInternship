## The Internship

The central research question I have tried to answer for TDE is 'How can I use generative AI to increase fan engagement?'. Fan engagement is a broad concept in this context - it doesn't mean that everything I build will need to be used by sports fans directly, but it should serve them or improve their experience when interacting with TDE's products, which in turn will increase engagement.
AI is a quickly evolving field of computer science, which is why TDE is very interested in exploring what opportunities it offers them. This assignment is a great opportunity to create multiple experimental applications that can show off the power of AI to potential customers.

## Learning Outcomes

**Learning outcome 1: Professional Duties**
> You carry out the professional duties on a junior bachelor level resulting in professional products in line with the IT-area you are working in.

**Learning outcome 2: Situation-orientation**
> You apply your previously acquired knowledge and skills in an authentic context to deliver relevant results for the project and company.

**Learning outcome 3 Future-Oriented Organisation** 
> You explore the organisational context of your project, make business, sustainable and ethical considerations and manage all aspects of the execution of the project.

**Learning outcome 4: Investigative Problem Solving**
> You take a critical look at your project from different perspectives, identify problems, find an effective approach and arrive at appropriate solutions.

**Learning outcome 5: Personal Leadership** 
> You are entrepreneurial around your projects and personal development, you pay attention to your own learning ability and keep in mind what kind of IT professional and/or what type of positions you aspire to.

**Learning outcome 6: Targeted Interaction**
> You determine which partners play a role in your project, collaborate constructively with them and communicate appropriately to achieve the desired impact.

## Internship Overview

### First Weeks

The first two weeks were spent getting to know the company, and getting to grips with my assignment. Early on, me and my coordinator at TDE decided that we would split the internship into four seperate projects, all focused on a different theme and subject within the field of generative AI. This way, I could explore more different avenues, as well as giving me the opportunity to swerve in direction if an exciting new direction suddenly opened up. Considering how fast the field of AI is moving nowadays, this is a very real possibility, and halfway through the internship TDE might suddenly think of something interesting I could be doing.

I tried to get a good idea of the current state of AI, and what the possibilities were. Based on this research, I outlined several concepts and themes I was interested in exploring, and together with my TDE coordinator we picked a few that we were most interested in. None of these were fixed, leaving the option for new ideas open.

After these two weeks, I had also landed on a general theme for my assignment; researching the ways in which generative AI can be used to increase fan engagement. 

### Project 1: Podcast Summarizer

I made an application that automatically transcribes and summarizes podcasts. It's intended to be used by the journalists of RacingNews365, a Formula 1 news site, who get a lot of their news from podcasts. This tool could save them a lot of time, by extracting just the most pertinent info, and indicating whether or not the podcast is worth listening to. Me and my TDE coordinator decided on this project as a good introduction to using generative AI models, as audio and text is a relatively simple subject within the field.

### Project 2: Sport Icons

TDE will be hosting a Web3 showcase, where they are inviting several high-profile executives in the sports industry to present the opportunities that several new technologies offer. As a part of this conference, they would like to show off something impressive created by generative AI. In keeping with TDE's sports focus, I made a tool that generates video and audio of a famous athlete based on text input, for example allowing you to generate a video of Michael jordan welcoming guests to the conference.
