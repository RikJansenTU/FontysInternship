# User Research Report
Project 3 was supposed to be used by the greater public, so it offered a good opportunity to do some user research. I wanted to find out how potential users felt about AI in general, as well as my projects in particular.

I sent out a short survey, asking respondents to give their opinion, ranging from 'fully disagree' to 'fully agree', on a variety of statements. I received 17 responses in total, most of which were 18-26 year old students, which isn't a big enough group to draw any confident conclusions from, but it does serve as an indication.

### General Opinion on AI
These questions covered how respondents felt about AI in general, its potential impact on our society, and its dangers.

### Opinion on the Projects

Still a lot of excitement, so lot of potential
