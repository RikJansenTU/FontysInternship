# User Research Report
Project 3 was supposed to be used by the greater public, so it offered a good opportunity to do some user research. I wanted to find out how potential users felt about AI in general, as well as my projects in particular.  
I sent out a short survey, asking respondents to give their opinion, ranging from 'fully disagree' to 'fully agree', on a variety of statements, as well as offering the opportunity for comment. I received 17 responses in total, most of which were 18-26 year old students, which isn't a big enough group to draw any confident conclusions from, but it does serve as an indication.

### General Opinion on AI
These questions covered how respondents felt about AI in general, its potential impact on our society, and its dangers. Out of 17 respondents, 14 professed to being at least a little bit worried about AI's impact on society, mostly about the jobs it could replace. 8 believed that AI had the potential to create an apocalyptic scenario that would exterminate society.  
13 out of 17 respondents believed additional laws were needed to regulate AI, but none believed that the technology should be banned completely. On the flip side, 15 out of 17 said they saw potential in AI as a useful tool, and believed it could be used to improve lives.

### Opinion on my Projects
This set of questions were about the projects I created, and whether or not the respondents felt they crossed ethical boundaries. Unsurprisingly, none of those surveyed said they had objections to the first project, although one person said it could reduce the worth of podcasters' work.  
The reaction to project 2 was much more mixed: 11 out of 17 respondents indicated the project crossed a line, although many of them did say their opinion was dependent on how exactly the tool was used. Releasing it to the public directly was seen as a net negative, but using it internally to create videos was looked upon more positively. Several respondents said they were open to the idea of it being used for parody, as long as it was made very clear that the result was AI generated.  
The reaction to project 3 was more positive, with only 2 respondents having ethical objections. The big difference seemed to be the fact that the tool is supposed to be used to generate images of yourself, which means that the subject of the image is in control of the end result and how it's shared.
Some respondents did say they were worried about data privacy, finding it important to know what exactly their pictures were being used for and whether or not they were being stored after being used to train the AI model.

### Conclusions
I didn't conduct this survey to gather expert opinions on AI, instead wanting to find out the general opinion on AI, as well as the opinion on what I was creating. Especially in the field of marketing, a company is always trying to give people a good impression, and if the view of AI were to be negative, it would be much more difficult to get the desired impact.  
Luckily, that doesn't seem to be the case (yet), but it's still essential to ensure your application of AI is seen as fun or original instead of crossing boundaries. Based on my results, I think the best way to achieve this is to give the power to users, by creating a tool that empowers them in some way, for example by letting them create something.
This way, people feel like they're in charge, and like they're able to do something they couldn't before, without fear of abuse or being replaced.

The discourse surrounding AI is highly active and changing constantly, so a project that might garner positive responses one month might be looked at negatively the next. Keeping up to date on public opinion, for example by looking at the reaction to other released projects and campaigns, will be essential in ensuring your work is always on the right side of the line.
