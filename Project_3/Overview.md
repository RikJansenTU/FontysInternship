# Project 3: In the Shoes Of...

## Research Questions
**How can I use generative AI to increase fan engagement?**  
This project is probably the one that most directly adresses this question
**What different types of generative AI exist, and how can they be used in innovative new ways?**  

**What are the needs of TDE's various customers, and how can I fulfill those?**  
Contrary to the other two projects, this one wasn't started specifically to fulfill a need of one of TDE's clients. Starting with a concept will mean there's some interesting research to be done into what client could best benefit from what I create, and how it could best be pitched to them.  
**Where does the passion of the sports fans that consume TDE's products lie, and how can I use AI to respond to those passions in a positive way?**  
Many people, including myself, are wary of AI as a technology. I want to use this project to investigate uses of AI that are positive and fun, and being able to offer something to sports fans directly is a great opportunity for that.
**What ethical considerations have to be taken into account when working with generative AI?**  
While people are supposed to make use of the tool voluntarily, which mitigates some of the ethical concerns, there is still a lot to be taken into account - misinformation or abuse are always a possibility, and data storage and privacy is still a concern. I want to make sure the tool is as safe as it can be, by examining how it could be abused and how I can prevent that.
## Project Process
### Initial Research
Hardest project so far, not even sure if its possible, needed a lot more research (see report)  


### Development

## Conclusions

### Ethics and Privacy
