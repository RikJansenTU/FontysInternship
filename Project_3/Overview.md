# Project 3: In the Shoes Of...  
An application that allows users to visualise themselves in the shoes of their favorite athletes using AI generated imagery. They can upload a few photos of themselves, which will be used to finetune an AI model so it can accurately replicate their face and place it in fictional sports-related scenes, creating something completely unique and personalized.

## Research Questions
- **How can I use generative AI to increase fan engagement?**  
This project is probably the one that most directly adresses this question, considering it's meant to be used by fans directly. I want to make use of that opportunity to do some user research, investigating how I can best engage people, and create something they're excited to use.  
- **What different types of generative AI exist, and how can they be used in innovative new ways?**  
This project is definitely even more on the bleeding edge of AI development than the previous two, meaning there are no ready-to-use APIs or tools I can use. This means I'll have to do preliminary research to investigate how and if what I want to do is possible, and how to best achieve good results.  
- **What are the needs of TDE's various customers, and how can I fulfill those?**  
Contrary to the other two projects, this one wasn't started specifically to fulfill a need of one of TDE's clients. Starting with a concept will mean there's some interesting research to be done into what client could best benefit from what I create, and how it could best be pitched to them.  
- **Where does the passion of the sports fans that consume TDE's products lie, and how can I use AI to respond to those passions in a positive way?**  
Many people, including myself, are wary of AI as a technology. I want to use this project to investigate uses of AI that are positive and fun, and being able to offer something to sports fans directly is a great opportunity for that.  
- **What ethical considerations have to be taken into account when working with generative AI?**  
While people are supposed to make use of the tool voluntarily, which mitigates some of the ethical concerns, there is still a lot to be taken into account - misinformation or abuse are always a possibility, and data storage and privacy is still a concern. I want to make sure the tool is as safe as it can be, by examining how it could be abused and how I can prevent that.  

## Project Process
### Initial Research and First Steps
Meeting with client leads to discuss who could use it - lots of potential, maybe save for something cooler  
  
Hardest project so far, not even sure if its possible, needed a lot more research (see report)  
Figured out a good way to do it, first experiment with tools before starting on code  

Also made Kanban board for planning
